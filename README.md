# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business. By analyzing customer behavior data, transaction history, and support interaction logs, the model identifies at-risk customers and suggests retention strategies.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost
- **Azure Databricks**: For model training and deployment
- **SQL Server**: Data storage and queries
- **Power BI**: Churn analysis and real-time prediction dashboard

## Key Features
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing data for model training
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying relevant features for churn prediction
- **Model Evaluation**: Using confusion matrix and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance
- **Real-Time Prediction Dashboard**: Visualizing churn predictions and strategies for retention
